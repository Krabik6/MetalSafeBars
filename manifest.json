  "description": "Fixes the invisible or partially missing health/shield bars issue that occurs on macOS when running Risk of Rain 2 through CrossOver. This bug is caused by shader/material incompatibility in the Wine environment, which makes parts of the UI fail to render. MetalSafeBars forces safe, always-visible rendering for HP, shield, and barrier bars â€” keeping their original behavior intact while ensuring full visibility. GUID: me.metalfix.ror2.healthbars",
